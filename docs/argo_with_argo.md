# Manage ArgoCD ... with ArgoCD!

It is possible to let ArgoCD manage itself! This is actually the recommended way of deploying ArgoCD, as described in the [docs](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#manage-argo-cd-using-argo-cd).

## Installing Tools

ArgoCD supports several ways of generating Kubernetes manifests.
Defining manifests is supported using different [Tools](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/application_sources/).

ArgoCD is very unopinionated and leaves the operator total freedom regarding
which tool to use to generate manifests. We will see:

* Kustomize
* Helm
* Plain YAML

### Kustomize

In the previous step, we installed ArgoCD manually using [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize).
In order to let ArgoCD manage itself, we need to make sure that it is able to run Kustomize

Open the `argocd_deploy/kustomization.yaml` file and uncomment the following section:

```
#patchesStrategicMerge:
#- overlays/argocd-cm.yaml
#- overlays/argocd-repo-server-deploy.yaml
```

After applying this change:
* Kustomize will be downloaded on boot
* ArgoCD will allow us to use it in our manifests

Apply the changes to the ArgoCD deployment by running:

```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/argocd_deploy:/app/manifests k8s.gcr.io/kustomize/kustomize:v3.10.0 build manifests | kubectl apply -f -
```

At this point, Kustomize is installed in our ArgoCD instance and ready to be used.
ArgoCD tools are useful also to test upgrades.

## Add ArgoCD to the managed applications

All the tools needed are now installed and we are ready to let ArgoCD manage itself.
Whenever possible we should define our applications in a declarative way, the same applies for ArgoCD

Find the ArgoCD definition at `argocd_deploy/apps/argocd.yaml`
Take some time to have a look at the file and replace the fields that need to be edited.

When you're done, uncomment this section from `argocd_deploy/kustomization.yaml`:

```
resources:
- resources/namespace.yaml
- apps/argocd.yaml
```

And apply the changes (last manual apply):

```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/argocd_deploy:/app/manifests k8s.gcr.io/kustomize/kustomize:v3.10.0 build manifests | kubectl apply -f -
```

With this change, ArgoCD is now managing itself using the definition in our repository.
Verify on ArgoCD interface that a new application has been installed and is working
